A left rotation operation on an array of size n shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. Given an integer, d, rotate the array that many steps left and return the result.

## Example

d = 2
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

After 2 rotations, [3, 4, 5, 1, 2].

## Function Description

rotateLeft has the following parameters:

- int d: the amount to rotate by
- int arr[n]: the array to rotate

## Returns

- int[n]: the rotated array

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers that denote n, the number of integers, and d, the number of left rotations to perform.
The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe arr[].
